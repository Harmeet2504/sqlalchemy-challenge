# sqlalchemy-challenge

Climate analysis for a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. 

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

To begin, Python and SQLAlchemy are used to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of climate database (Resources/hawaii.sqlite). 
All analysis are completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Step 2 - Climate App

Next a Flask API is designed based on the queries that was developed in step 1. Queries are returned as json object.
